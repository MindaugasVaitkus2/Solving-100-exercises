:exclamation: For Exercise 98 I used Python 3 because:
[tkdocs](http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html)
> Tkinter are included with all standard distributions on Mac OS.
> If you're a masochist and want to read about other Tcl/Tk options and variations and how they interact with Python, see the Mac Tcl/Tk page at python.org.
